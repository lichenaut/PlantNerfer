#Note: 'dark' light levels are between and including 0 and 7.
#Note 2: different plants have different numbers of growth stages, which means the same growth rate can affect some plants more than others.
#Note 3: for a successful bone meal fertilization growth, the plant must go through bone meal rate, growth rate, and vanilla bone meal chance checks.
